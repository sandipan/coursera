    "We see a similar trade-off between quality and performance: as the number of random vectors increases, the query time goes down as each bin contains fewer documents on average, but on average the neighbors are likewise placed farther from the query. On the other hand, when using a small enough number of random vectors, LSH becomes very similar brute-force search: Many documents appear in a single bin, so searching the query bin alone covers a lot of the corpus; then, including neighboring bins might result in searching all documents, just as in the brute-force approach."
