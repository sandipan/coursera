    "Decision tree analysis was performed to test nonlinear relationships among a series of explanatory variables and a binary, categorical response variable. All possible separations (categorical) or cut points (quantitative) are tested. For the present analyses, the entropy “goodness of split” criterion was used to grow the tree and a cost complexity algorithm was used for pruning the full tree into a final subtree.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following explanatory variables were included as possible contributors to a classification tree model evaluating smoking experimentation (my response variable), age, gender, (race/ethnicity) Hispanic, White, Black, Native American and Asian. Alcohol use, marijuana use, cocaine use, inhalant use, availability of cigarettes in the home, whether or not either parent was on public assistance, any experience with being expelled from school. alcohol problems, deviance, violence, depression, self-esteem, parental presence, parental activities, family connectedness, school connectedness and grade point average.\n",
    "\n",
    "The deviance score was the first variable to separate the sample into two subgroups. Adolescents with a deviance score greater than 0.112 (range 0 to 2.8 –M=0.13, SD=0.209) were more likely to have experimented with smoking compared to adolescents not meeting this cutoff (18.6% vs. 11.2%).\n",
    "\n",
    "Of the adolescents with deviance scores less than or equal to 0.112, a further subdivision was made with the dichotomous variable of alcohol use without supervision. Adolescents who reported having used alcohol without supervision were more likely to have experimented with smoking. Adolescents with a deviance score less than or equal to 0.112 who had never drank alcohol were less likely to have experimented with smoking. The total model classified 63% of the sample correctly, 52% of experimenters (sensitivity) and 65% of nonsmokers (specificity)."
