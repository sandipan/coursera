# # Improvise a Jazz Solo with an LSTM Network
# 
# Welcome to your final programming assignment of this week! In this notebook, you will implement a model that uses an LSTM to generate music. You will even be able to listen to your own music at the end of the assignment. 
# 
# **You will learn to:**
# - Apply an LSTM to music generation.
# - Generate your own jazz music with deep learning.
# 
# Please run the following cell to load all the packages required in this assignment. This may take a few minutes.

# ## 1 - Problem statement
# 
# You would like to create a jazz music piece specially for a friend's birthday. However, you don't know any instruments or music composition. Fortunately, you know deep learning and will solve this problem using an LSTM netwok.  
# 
# You will train a network to generate novel jazz solos in a style representative of a body of performed work.
#

# 
# 
# ### 1.1 - Dataset
# 
# You will train your algorithm on a corpus of Jazz music. Run the cell below to listen to a snippet of the audio from the training set:

# In[2]:

IPython.display.Audio('./data/30s_seq.mp3')


# We have taken care of the preprocessing of the musical data to render it in terms of musical "values." You can informally think of each "value" as a note, which comprises a pitch and a duration. For example, if you press down a specific piano key for 0.5 seconds, then you have just played a note. In music theory, a "value" is actually more complicated than this--specifically, it also captures the information needed to play multiple notes at the same time. For example, when playing a music piece, you might press down two piano keys at the same time (playng multiple notes at the same time generates what's called a "chord"). But we don't need to worry about the details of music theory for this assignment. For the purpose of this assignment, all you need to know is that we will obtain a dataset of values, and will learn an RNN model to generate sequences of values. 
# 
# Our music generation system will use 78 unique values. Run the following code to load the raw music data and preprocess it into values. This might take a few minutes.

# In[3]:

X, Y, n_values, indices_values = load_music_utils()
print('shape of X:', X.shape)
print('number of training examples:', X.shape[0])
print('Tx (length of sequence):', X.shape[1])
print('total # of unique values:', n_values)
print('Shape of Y:', Y.shape)


# You have just loaded the following:
# 
# - `X`: This is an (m, $T_x$, 78) dimensional array. We have m training examples, each of which is a snippet of $T_x =30$ musical values. At each time step, the input is one of 78 different possible values, represented as a one-hot vector. Thus for example, X[i,t,:] is a one-hot vector representating the value of the i-th example at time t. 
# 
# - `Y`: This is essentially the same as `X`, but shifted one step to the left (to the past). Similar to the dinosaurus assignment, we're interested in the network using the previous values to predict the next value, so our sequence model will try to predict $y^{\langle t \rangle}$ given $x^{\langle 1\rangle}, \ldots, x^{\langle t \rangle}$. However, the data in `Y` is reordered to be dimension $(T_y, m, 78)$, where $T_y = T_x$. This format makes it more convenient to feed to the LSTM later. 
# 
# - `n_values`: The number of unique values in this dataset. This should be 78. 
# 
# - `indices_values`: python dictionary mapping from 0-77 to musical values.

# ### 1.2 - Overview of our model
# 
# Here is the architecture of the model we will use. This is similar to the Dinosaurus model you had used in the previous notebook, except that in you will be implementing it in Keras. The architecture is as follows: 
# 
# <img src="images/music_generation.png" style="width:600;height:400px;">
# 
# <!--
# <img src="images/djmodel.png" style="width:600;height:400px;">
# <br>
# <caption><center> **Figure 1**: LSTM model. $X = (x^{\langle 1 \rangle}, x^{\langle 2 \rangle}, ..., x^{\langle T_x \rangle})$ is a window of size $T_x$ scanned over the musical corpus. Each $x^{\langle t \rangle}$ is an index corresponding to a value (ex: "A,0.250,< m2,P-4 >") while $\hat{y}$ is the prediction for the next value  </center></caption>
# !--> 
# 
# We will be training the model on random snippets of 30 values taken from a much longer piece of music. Thus, we won't bother to set the first input $x^{\langle 1 \rangle} = \vec{0}$, which we had done previously to denote the start of a dinosaur name, since now most of these snippets of audio start somewhere in the middle of a piece of music. We are setting each of the snippts to have the same length $T_x = 30$ to make vectorization easier. 
# 

# ## 2 - Building the model
# 
# In this part you will build and train a model that will learn musical patterns. To do so, you will need to build a model that takes in X of shape $(m, T_x, 78)$ and Y of shape $(T_y, m, 78)$. We will use an LSTM with 64 dimensional hidden states. Lets set `n_a = 64`. 
# 

# In[4]:

n_a = 64 


# 
# Here's how you can create a Keras model with multiple inputs and outputs. If you're building an RNN where even at test time entire input sequence $x^{\langle 1 \rangle}, x^{\langle 2 \rangle}, \ldots, x^{\langle T_x \rangle}$ were *given in advance*, for example if the inputs were words and the output was a label, then Keras has simple built-in functions to build the model. However, for sequence generation, at test time we don't know all the values of $x^{\langle t\rangle}$ in advance; instead we generate them one at a time using $x^{\langle t\rangle} = y^{\langle t-1 \rangle}$. So the code will be a bit more complicated, and you'll need to implement your own for-loop to iterate over the different time steps. 
# 
# The function `djmodel()` will call the LSTM layer $T_x$ times using a for-loop, and it is important that all $T_x$ copies have the same weights. I.e., it should not re-initiaiize the weights every time---the $T_x$ steps should have shared weights. The key steps for implementing layers with shareable weights in Keras are: 
# 1. Define the layer objects (we will use global variables for this).
# 2. Call these objects when propagating the input.
# 
# We have defined the layers objects you need as global variables. Please run the next cell to create them. Please check the Keras documentation to make sure you understand what these layers are: [Reshape()](https://keras.io/layers/core/#reshape), [LSTM()](https://keras.io/layers/recurrent/#lstm), [Dense()](https://keras.io/layers/core/#dense).
# 

# In[5]:

reshapor = Reshape((1, 78))                        # Used in Step 2.B of djmodel(), below
LSTM_cell = LSTM(n_a, return_state = True)         # Used in Step 2.C
densor = Dense(n_values, activation='softmax')     # Used in Step 2.D


# Each of `reshapor`, `LSTM_cell` and `densor` are now layer objects, and you can use them to implement `djmodel()`. In order to propagate a Keras tensor object X through one of these layers, use `layer_object(X)` (or `layer_object([X,Y])` if it requires multiple inputs.). For example, `reshapor(X)` will propagate X through the `Reshape((1,78))` layer defined above.

#  
# **Exercise**: Implement `djmodel()`. You will need to carry out 2 steps:
# 
# 1. Create an empty list "outputs" to save the outputs of the LSTM Cell at every time step.
# 2. Loop for $t \in 1, \ldots, T_x$:
# 
#     A. Select the "t"th time-step vector from X. The shape of this selection should be (78,). To do so, create a custom [Lambda](https://keras.io/layers/core/#lambda) layer in Keras by using this line of code:
# ```    
#            x = Lambda(lambda x: X[:,t,:])(X)
# ``` 
# Look over the Keras documentation to figure out what this does. It is creating a "temporary" or "unnamed" function (that's what Lambda functions are) that extracts out the appropriate one-hot vector, and making this function a Keras `Layer` object to apply to `X`. 
# 
#     B. Reshape x to be (1,78). You may find the `reshapor()` layer (defined below) helpful.
# 
#     C. Run x through one step of LSTM_cell. Remember to initialize the LSTM_cell with the previous step's hidden state $a$ and cell state $c$. Use the following formatting:
# ```python
# a, _, c = LSTM_cell(input_x, initial_state=[previous hidden state, previous cell state])
# ```
# 
#     D. Propagate the LSTM's output activation value through a dense+softmax layer using `densor`. 
#     
#     E. Append the predicted value to the list of "outputs"
#

model.fit([X, a0, c0], list(Y), epochs=100)


# You should see the model loss going down. Now that you have trained a model, lets go on the the final section to implement an inference algorithm, and generate some music! 

# ## 3 - Generating music
# 
# You now have a trained model which has learned the patterns of the jazz soloist. Lets now use this model to synthesize new music. 
# 
# #### 3.1 - Predicting & Sampling
# 
# <img src="images/music_gen.png" style="width:600;height:400px;">
# 
# At each step of sampling, you will take as input the activation `a` and cell state `c` from the previous state of the LSTM, forward propagate by one step, and get a new output activation as well as cell state. The new activation `a` can then be used to generate the output, using `densor` as before. 
# 
# To start off the model, we will initialize `x0` as well as the LSTM activation and and cell value `a0` and `c0` to be zeros. 
# 
# 
# <!-- 
# You are about to build a function that will do this inference for you. Your function takes in your previous model and the number of time steps `Ty` that you want to sample. It will return a keras model that would be able to generate sequences for you. Furthermore, the function takes in a dense layer of `78` units and the number of activations. 
# !--> 
# 
# 
# **Exercise:** Implement the function below to sample a sequence of musical values. Here are some of the key steps you'll need to implement inside the for-loop that generates the $T_y$ output characters: 
# 
# Step 2.A: Use `LSTM_Cell`, which inputs the previous step's `c` and `a` to generate the current step's `c` and `a`. 
# 
# Step 2.B: Use `densor` (defined previously) to compute a softmax on `a` to get the output for the current step. 
# 
# Step 2.C: Save the output you have just generated by appending it to `outputs`.
# 
# Step 2.D: Sample x to the be "out"'s one-hot version (the prediction) so that you can pass it to the next LSTM's step.  We have already provided this line of code, which uses a [Lambda](https://keras.io/layers/core/#lambda) function. 
# ```python
# x = Lambda(one_hot)(out) 
# ```
# [Minor technical note: Rather than sampling a value at random according to the probabilities in `out`, this line of code actually chooses the single most likely note at each step using an argmax.]

# #### 3.3 - Generate music 
# 
# Finally, you are ready to generate music. Your RNN generates a sequence of values. The following code generates music by first calling your `predict_and_sample()` function. These values are then post-processed into musical chords (meaning that multiple values or notes can be played at the same time). 
# 
# Most computational music algorithms use some post-processing because it is difficult to generate music that sounds good without such post-processing. The post-processing does things such as clean up the generated audio by making sure the same sound is not repeated too many times, that two successive notes are not too far from each other in pitch, and so on. One could argue that a lot of these post-processing steps are hacks; also, a lot the music generation literature has also focused on hand-crafting post-processors, and a lot of the output quality depends on the quality of the post-processing and not just the quality of the RNN. But this post-processing does make a huge difference, so lets use it in our implementation as well. 
# 
# Lets make some music! 

# Run the following cell to generate music and record it into your `out_stream`. This can take a couple of minutes.

# In[ ]:

out_stream = generate_music(inference_model)


# To listen to your music, click File->Open... Then go to "output/" and download "my_music.midi". Either play it on your computer with an application that can read midi files if you have one, or use one of the free online "MIDI to mp3" conversion tools to convert this to mp3.

# ### Congratulations!
# 
# You have come to the end of the notebook. 
# 
# <font color="blue">
# Here's what you should remember:
# - A sequence model can be used to generate musical values, which are then post-processed into midi music. 
# - Fairly similar models can be used to generate dinosaur names or to generate music, with the major difference being the input fed to the model.  
# - In Keras, sequence generation involves defining layers with shared weights, which are then repeated for the different time steps $1, \ldots, T_x$. 

# Congratulations on completing this assignment and generating a jazz solo!
