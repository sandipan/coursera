{"courseType":"v2.capstone","description":"Learners will design a DC-DC converter that powers USB-C devices (20 V at 3 A) from a dc input voltage source such as a lithium-ion battery pack or a desktop computer power bus. Aspects of the project will include: \n \n●  Design of converter power stage and magnetics. Requires mastery of courses 1, 2, and 5. \n●  Simulation to verify correct steady-state operation. Requires mastery of courses 1, 2 and 4. \n●  Design of converter control system. Requires mastery of courses 3 and 4. \n●  Simulation to verify correct control system operation. Requires mastery of courses 3 and 4. \n●  Preparation of milestone reports documenting the design and its performance  \n \nThe reports will be peer graded.","id":"lD6srSmGEeWEOhKP8F7imw","slug":"power-electronics-capstone","instructorIds":["2659612","3376074","14418174"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["71"],"name":"Capstone Design Project in Power Electronics"}
