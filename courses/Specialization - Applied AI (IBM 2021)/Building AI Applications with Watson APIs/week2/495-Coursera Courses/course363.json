{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"So how does the American political system work? Who are some of the key actors? What are key concepts for a student trying to understand what’s going on? How can I as a citizen influence politics? \n\nCivic Engagement in American Democracy takes on these and other key questions. We’re Dr. Nicholas Carnes and Dr. Bruce Jentleson, the principal course instructors. Along with our Duke faculty colleagues who also contributed modules, we’ve designed the course to provide a strong foundational introduction to US politics. \n\nIf you’re new to this material, proceed through the modules one by one and build up your knowledge of politics and government. If some of the material is familiar, go ahead and set your own pace. Either way we hope Civic Engagement in American Democracy helps you be an effective student in more advanced politics courses and/or an engaged citizen in 21st century America.","id":"ETV0lFtwEeeN9RJSuE6_vA","slug":"civic-engagement-american-democracy","instructorIds":["3279667","29494085","29503070","27303148","29696186","29789062","29842890","29861825"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["7"],"name":"Civic Engagement in American Democracy"}
