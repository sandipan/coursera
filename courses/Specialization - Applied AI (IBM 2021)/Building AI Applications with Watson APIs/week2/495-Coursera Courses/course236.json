{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"This course applies principles learned in my course “Introduction to Engineering Mechanics” to analyze real world engineering structures.  You will need to have mastered the engineering fundamentals from that class in order to be successful in this course offering.  This course addresses the modeling and analysis of static equilibrium problems with an emphasis on real world engineering systems and problem solving.  \n\n---------------------------\nRecommended Background:\n\nYou will need to have successfully completed my earlier course “Introduction to Engineering Mechanics” in order to be successful in this course.\n\n---------------------------\nThe copyright of all content and materials in this course are owned by either the Georgia Tech Research Corporation or Dr. Wayne Whiteman.
