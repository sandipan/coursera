{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Human structure is important to all of us as it has been for millennia.  Artists, teachers, health care providers, scientists and most children try to understand the human form from stick figure drawings to electron microscopy. Learning the form of people is of great interest to us – physicians, nurses, physician assistants, emergency medical services personnel and many, many others.\n\nLearning anatomy classically involved dissection of the deceased whether directly in the laboratory or from texts, drawings, photographs or videos.  There are many wonderful resources for the study of anatomy.  Developing an understanding of the human form requires significant work and a wide range of resources.\n\nIn this course, we have attempted to present succinct videos of human anatomy.  Some will find these images to be disturbing and these images carry a need to respect the individual who decided to donate their remains to benefit our teaching and learning.\n\nAll of the dissections depicted in the following videos are from individuals who gave their remains to be used in the advancement of medical education and research after death to the Yale School of Medicine.\n\nThe sequence of videos is divided into classic anatomic sections.  Each video has a set of learning objectives and a brief quiz at the end.  Following each section there is another quiz covering the entire section in order for you to test your knowledge.  \n\nWe hope these videos will help you better understand the human form, make time that you may have in the laboratory more worthwhile if you have that opportunity and help you develop an appreciation of the wonderful intricacies of people.\n\nWARNING:\nTHESE VIDEOS CONTAIN IMAGES OF HUMAN DISSECTION. MAY BE DISTURBING TO SOME.\n\n\nThis work was supported in part by the Kaplow Family Fund, Yale School of Medicine.\f\nCOURSE CURRICULUM:  ANATOMY OF THE THORAX, HEART, ABDOMEN AND PELVIS\n\nRECOMMENDED TEXT\t\nGRAY’S ANATOMY FOR STUDENTS, RICHARD L DRAKE, ELSEVIER.
