{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Meeting another person is one of the most amazing experiences you can have in Virtual Reality. It is quite unlike communicating through any other medium except a real life face-to-face conversation. Because the other person is life size and shares a virtual space with you, body language works in a way that cannot be done on a flat screen. This course will enable you to create realistic social interactions in VR. \n\nYou will learn about both the psychology of social interaction and the practical skills to implement it in Unity3D. We will take you through the basics of 3D character animation and how to create body language. You will learn about how to make characters that can respond to playersâ€™ speech and body language. You will also learn about avatars: the virtual representation of other players, and agents: computer controlled NPC characters and how to implement both of them. \n\nAs many people have said before us, social is the future of VR. This course will help you become part of the future of Virtual Reality social experiences.","id":"dc1vwfjcEeaRLwq7mFlYug","slug":"interactive-3d-characters-social-virtual-reality","instructorIds":["24333271","1620951"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["26","303"],"name":"Building Interactive 3D Characters and Social VR"}
