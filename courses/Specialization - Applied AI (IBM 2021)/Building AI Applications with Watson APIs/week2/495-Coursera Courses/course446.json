{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"This course presents in-depth discussion and analysis of pn junction and metal-semiconductor contacts including equilibrium behavior, current and capacitance responses under bias, breakdown, non-rectifying behavior, and surface effect. You'll work through sophisticated analysis and application to electronic devices.\n\nAt the end of this course learners will be able to:\n1. Analyze pn junction at equilibrium and under bias, capacitance and current characteristics, and breakdown behavior\n2. Analyze metal-semiconductor contact at equilibrium and under bias, capacitance and current characteristics, non-rectifying contact and surface effects","id":"Y2Lu2G4mEeeWCg71xNIlJg","slug":"diode-pn-junction-metal-semiconductor-contact","instructorIds":["26396706"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["71"],"name":"Diode - pn Junction and Metal Semiconductor Contact"}
