{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"This course covers advanced converter control techniques, including averaged-switch modeling and Spice simulations, modeling and design of peak current mode and average current mode controlled converters, as well as an introduction to control of single-phase ac grid tied rectifiers and inverters. Design and simulation examples include wide bandwidth point-of-load voltage regulators, low-harmonic power-factor-correction rectifiers, and grid-tied inverters for solar photovoltaic power systems. Upon completion of the course, you will be able to model, design control loops, and simulate state-of-the-art pulse-width modulated (PWM) dc-dc converters, dc-ac inverters, ac-dc rectifiers, and other power electronics systems. \n\nThis course assumes prior completion of Introduction to Power Electronics, Converter Circuits, and Converter Control","id":"Wa2LIymGEeWFggqB2SRvtQ","slug":"current-control","instructorIds":["3376074"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["71"],"name":"Advanced Converter Control Techniques"}
