{"courseType":"v2.capstone","description":"The Final Research Project consists of a research study that you will perform in collaboration with fellow learners. Together you will formulate a research hypothesis and design, come up with operationalizations, create manipulation and measurement instruments, collect data, perform statistical analyses and document the results. \n\nIn this course you will go through the entire research process and will be able to help determine what research question we will investigate and how we design and perform the research. This is an invaluable experience if you want to be able to critically evaluate scientific research in the social and behavioral sciences or design and perform your own studies in the future.","id":"FgBcI0qwEeWzkQpjUi2OvQ","slug":"social-science-capstone","instructorIds":["959950"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["131"],"name":"Methods and Statistics in Social Science - Final Research Project"}
