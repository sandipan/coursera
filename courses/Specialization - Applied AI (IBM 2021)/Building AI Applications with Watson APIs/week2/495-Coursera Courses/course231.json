{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"This course will provide you a foundational understanding of machine learning models (logistic regression, multilayer perceptrons, convolutional neural networks, natural language processing, etc.) as well as demonstrate how these models can solve complex problems in a variety of industries, from medical diagnostics to image recognition to text prediction. In addition, we have designed practice exercises that will give you hands-on experience implementing these data science models on data sets. These practice exercises will teach you how to implement machine learning algorithms with TensorFlow, open source libraries used by leading tech companies in the machine learning field (e.g., Google, NVIDIA, CocaCola, eBay, Snapchat, Uber and many more).","id":"8BJHzZD_EeiKohJBs5wRGA","slug":"machine-learning-duke","instructorIds":["36385260"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["7"],"name":"Introduction to Machine Learning"}
