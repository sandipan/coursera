{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Apache Spark is the de-facto standard for large scale data processing. This is the first course of a series of courses towards the IBM Advanced Data Science Specialization. We strongly believe that is is crucial for success to start learning a scalable data science platform since memory and CPU constraints are to most limiting factors when it comes to building advanced machine learning models.\n\nIn this course we teach you the fundamentals of Apache Spark using python and pyspark. We'll introduce Apache Spark in the first two weeks and learn how to apply it to compute basic exploratory and data pre-processing tasks in the last two weeks. Through this exercise you'll also be introduced to the most fundamental statistical measures and data visualization technologies.\n\nThis gives you enough knowledge to take over the role of a data engineer in any modern environment. But it gives you also the basis for advancing your career towards data science. \n\nPlease have a look at the full specialization curriculum:\nhttps://www.coursera.org/specializations/advanced-data-science-ibm\n\nIf you choose to take this course and earn the Coursera course certificate, you will also earn an IBM digital badge.  To find out more about IBM digital badges follow the link ibm.biz/badging.\n\n\nAfter completing this course, you will be able to:\n•\tDescribe how basic statistical measures, are used to reveal  patterns within the data \n•\tRecognize data characteristics, patterns, trends, deviations or inconsistencies, and potential outliers.\n•\tIdentify useful techniques for working with big data such as dimension reduction and feature selection methods \n•\tUse advanced tools and charting libraries to:\n      o\timprove efficiency of analysis of big-data with partitioning and parallel analysis \n      o\tVisualize the data in an number of 2D and 3D formats (Box Plot, Run Chart, Scatter Plot, Pareto Chart, and Multidimensional Scaling)\n\nFor successful completion of the course, the following prerequisites are recommended: \n•\tBasic programming skills in python\n•\tBasic math\n•\tBasic SQL\n\nIn order to complete this course, the following technologies will be used:\n(These technologies are introduced in the course as necessary so no previous knowledge is required.)\n•\tJupyter notebooks (brought to you by IBM Watson Studio for free)\n•\tApacheSpark (brought to you by IBM Watson Studio for free)\n•\tPython\n\nThis course takes four weeks, 4-6h per week","id":"sUpST4RAEeawAApvKZgcCQ","slug":"ds","instructorIds":["18682389"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["348"],"name":"Fundamentals of Scalable Data Science"}
