{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Starting in the late 1990s, “globalization” became a buzzword to describe the apparent integration of markets in the world economy. Many authors and pundits claimed that the world was converging towards a market-friendly democratic place, while gurus and consulting firms were not short of formulae and advice on how to make profits out of the global economy. Decades later, new realities show that globalization does not mean political, cultural, and economic convergence and that forces against it are strong.\n\nThis course seeks to help you understand the forces of globalization and how cross-cultural management and the relationship of a multinational organization to various host countries is becoming more and more critical in today’s global economy. This course begins with the discussion of these issues and global relationships and delves into a deeper understanding of business strategy in today’s global business marketplace.\n\nUpon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:\n•\tUnderstand how we got here and why it matters\n•\tUnderstand the complexities of the current globalization (not all countries are the same)\n•\tEvaluate the effects of international trade regulations on international business\n•\tEvaluate when and why should we operate as multinationals\n\nThis course is part of the iMBA offered by the University of Illinois, a flexible, fully-accredited online MBA at an incredibly competitive price.
