{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Health data are notable for how many types there are, how complex they are, and how serious it is to get them straight. These data are used for treatment of the patient from whom they derive, but also for other uses. Examples of such secondary use of health data include population health (e.g., who requires more attention), research (e.g., which drug is more effective in practice), quality (e.g., is the institution meeting benchmarks), and translational research (e.g., are new technologies being applied appropriately). By the end of this course, students will recognize the different types of health and healthcare data, will articulate a coherent and complete question, will interpret queries designed for secondary use of EHR data, and will interpret the results of those queries.","id":"VjzKP0Q1EeiJ2RKoe7qovg","slug":"the-data-science-of-health-informatics","instructorIds":["39588106","37346238"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["8"],"name":"The Data Science of Health Informatics"}
