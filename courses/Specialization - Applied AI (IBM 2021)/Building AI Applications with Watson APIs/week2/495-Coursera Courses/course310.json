{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Businesses run on data, and data offers little value without analytics. The ability to process data to make predictions about the behavior of individuals or markets, to diagnose systems or situations, or to prescribe actions for people or processes drives business today. Increasingly many businesses are striving to become “data-driven”, proactively relying more on cold hard information and sophisticated algorithms than upon the gut instinct or slow reactions of humans. \n\nThis course will focus on understanding key analytics concepts and the breadth of analytic possibilities. Together, the class will explore dozens of real-world analytics problems and solutions across most major industries and business functions. The course will also touch on analytic technologies, architectures, and roles from business intelligence to data science, and from data warehouses to data lakes. And the course will wrap up with a discussion of analytics trends and futures.","id":"lQpeAht8EemDxxJ40YD1SA","slug":"business-analytics-executive-overview","instructorIds":["35411911"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["17"],"name":"Business Analytics Executive Overview"}
