{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"This course will introduce you to Virtual Reality (VR). The course will teach you everything from the basics of VR- the hardware and the history of VR- to different applications of VR, the psychology of Virtual Reality, and the challenges of the medium.\n\nThe course is designed for people who are new to VR as a medium. You may have experienced some virtual reality before, and may have some hardware- but this course is suitable to individuals who have never experienced VR and those who do not have much hardware- we will explain Mobile VR as well as devices such as the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive.\n\nIntroduction to Virtual Reality is the first course in the Virtual Reality Specialisation. A learner with no previous experience in Virtual Reality and/or game programming will be able to evaluate existing VR applications, and design, test, and implement their own VR experiences/games using Unity by the end of the specialisation.","id":"pXYrg_jbEeaRvRLVBNP8Xg","slug":"introduction-virtual-reality","instructorIds":["24333271","1620951"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["26","303"],"name":"Introduction to Virtual Reality"}
