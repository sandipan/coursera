{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"In this course, we'll look at the JavaScript language, and how it supports the Object-Oriented pattern, with a focus on the unique aspect of how JavaScript approaches OO. We'll explore a brief introduction to the jQuery library, which is widely used to do in-browser manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM) and event handling. You'll also learn more about JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), which is commonly used as a syntax to exchange data between code running on the server (i.e. in PHP) and code running in the browser (JavaScript/jQuery).\n\nIt is assumed that learners have already taken the Building Web Applications and Building Database Applications in PHP courses in this specialization.","id":"9Z1XvVwuEeeVDg6Hr_aQ1g","slug":"javascript-jquery-json","instructorIds":["122340"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["3"],"name":"JavaScript, jQuery, and JSON"}
