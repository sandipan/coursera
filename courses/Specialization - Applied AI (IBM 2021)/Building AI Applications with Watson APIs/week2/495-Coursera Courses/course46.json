{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"You may have noticed that what is new often behaves differently than what has become accepted over time, whether it is in a market, or a technology, or involves people and firms.  Much research supports these general ideas, and this course builds on them to help you develop a perspective on managing innovation.  That is, you will build your capability to lead and design your organization in effectively implementing innovation initiatives and achieving their strategic intent.  \n\nTo do this, you will learn a set of frameworks, tools, and concepts that can help you address several important challenges in managing innovation.  The first challenge regards how to successfully implement innovation efforts within established firms and alongside established businesses.  You then investigate the particulars of managing innovation when disruptive technologies are involved.  Other topics include leadership of new product development teams, planning and evaluation of innovation initiatives, and management of innovation across organizational boundaries, as happens with alliances or virtual firms.","id":"nW1dUu13Eea2mxLTB28_VA","slug":"strategic-innovation-innovation-at-the-frontier","instructorIds":["26864992"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["17"],"name":"Strategic Innovation: Managing Innovation Initiatives"}
