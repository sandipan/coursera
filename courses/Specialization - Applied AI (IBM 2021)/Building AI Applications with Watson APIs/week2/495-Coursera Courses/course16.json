{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Few kinds of communication can have the effect of a powerful presentation.  Even a short speech can motivate people to change long-held beliefs or to take action, and a wonderfully delivered speech can transform a normal person into a leader.\n\nIn this course, Prof. William Kuskin provides a series of pragmatic videos and exercises for successful public speaking and presentations. The course develops through four themes—mastering fear, developing a creative formula, using verbal and body language, and anticipating the room—so that you can discover your personal power as a speaker and give excellent presentations.  \n\nSuccessful presentations do not rely on perfect teeth, a deep voice, or an army of scriptwriters.  They depend largely on the same skills as successful Business Writing and Graphic Design: clarity, structure, and revision. The goal of the course, therefore, is to enable you to discover your own internal power as a speaker and express it to the world.  After this course, with some practice, you will be able to go into any situation and command the room for as long as you like.
