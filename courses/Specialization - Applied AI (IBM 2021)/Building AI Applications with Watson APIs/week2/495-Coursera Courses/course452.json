{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Learn how to analyze data using Python. This course will take you from the basics of Python to exploring many different types of data. You will learn how to prepare data for analysis, perform simple statistical analysis, create meaningful data visualizations, predict future trends from data, and more!\n\nTopics covered:\n\n1) Importing Datasets\n2) Cleaning the Data\n3) Data frame manipulation\n4) Summarizing the Data\n5) Building machine learning Regression models\n6) Building data pipelines\n\n Data Analysis with Python will be delivered through lecture, lab, and assignments. It includes following parts:\n\nData Analysis libraries: will learn to use Pandas, Numpy and Scipy libraries to work with a sample dataset. We will introduce you to pandas, an open-source library, and we will use it to load, manipulate, analyze, and visualize cool datasets. Then we will introduce you to another open-source library, scikit-learn, and we will use some of its machine learning algorithms to build smart models and make cool predictions.\n\nIf you choose to take this course and earn the Coursera course certificate, you will also earn an IBM digital badge.  \n\nLIMITED TIME OFFER: Subscription is only $39 USD per month for access to graded materials and a certificate.","id":"fYuElDEgEeiCvhLLCIZW_A","slug":"data-analysis-with-python","instructorIds":["28511493"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["348"],"name":"Data Analysis with Python"}
