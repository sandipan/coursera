{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Are you a living creature? Then, congratulations! You’ve got DNA. But how much do you really know about the microscopic molecules that make you unique? \n\nWhy is DNA called the “blueprint of life”? \nWhat is a “DNA fingerprint”?\nHow do scientists clone DNA? \nWhat can DNA teach you about your family history?\nAre Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) safe?\nIs it possible to revive dinosaurs by cloning their DNA? \n\nDNA Decoded answers these questions and more. If you’re curious about DNA, join Felicia Vulcu and Caitlin Mullarkey, two biochemists from McMaster University, as they explore the structure of DNA, how scientists cracked the genetic code, and what our DNA can tell us about ourselves. Along the way, you’ll learn about the practical techniques that scientists use to analyze our genetic risks, to manipulate DNA, and to develop new treatments for a range of different diseases. Then, step into our virtual lab to perform your own forensic DNA analysis of samples from a crime scene and solve a murder.","id":"XtG-3iXXEee9kRIpW6HxRg","slug":"dna-decoded","instructorIds":["25111224","3568545"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["148"],"name":"DNA Decoded"}
