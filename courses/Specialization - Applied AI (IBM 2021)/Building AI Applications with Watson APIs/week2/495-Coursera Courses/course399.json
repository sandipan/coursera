{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Learn about traditional and mobile malware, the security threats they represent, state-of-the-art analysis and detection techniques, and the underground ecosystem that drives such a profitable but illegal business.\n\nMalicious Software and its Underground Economy: Two Sides to Every Story is a short, introductory, and experimental (i.e., pilot) course featuring 6 lectures. Each lecture lasts roughly anything between 1h and 1.5h and is logically divided in a number of ~15 mins self-contained units. Although a non-negligible effort has been made to fulfill this breakdown, some units last definitely longer and require a bit more effort---just pause the video and take a break ;-)\n\nIn addition, the course features 6 multiple-choices mandatory quizzes (i.e., 1 per lecture) and 1 bonus quiz. Passing all the mandatory quizzes awards a \"pass\" mark of the course, while passing all the mandatory quizzes and the bonus one awards a \"distinction\" mark.","id":"kJKZg6jiEeWoKQ4rUD57pQ","slug":"malsoftware","instructorIds":["1347691"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["26"],"name":"Malicious Software and its Underground Economy: Two Sides to Every Story"}
