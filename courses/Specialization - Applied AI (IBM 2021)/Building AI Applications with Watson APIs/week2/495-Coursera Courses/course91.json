{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Since many software developers are compulsive coders, they have created software over the years to help them do their job.  There are tools which make design and its associated tasks easier.  The course introduces some basic tools and techniques to help you with design.  Tools arenâ€™t always tangible, however.  The last two lessons of this course discuss questions of Ethics in software development. The purpose here is, as with tools, to equip you to better carry our your responsibilities as a designer. Students will be required to have a prior knowledge of writing and delivering software and some programming knowledge in java.","id":"xkJeRWOTEeeqbxLIz9M6nA","slug":"software-design-methods-tools","instructorIds":["20861395"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["126"],"name":"Software Design Methods and Tools"}
