{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"This course teaches you to fetch and process data from services on the Internet. It covers Python list comprehensions and provides opportunities to practice extracting from and processing deeply nested data. You'll also learn how to use the Python requests module to interact with REST APIs and what to look for in documentation of those APIs. For the final project, you will construct a “tag recommender” for the flickr photo sharing site.\n\nThe course is well-suited for you if you have already taken the \"Python Basics\" and \"Python Functions, Files, and Dictionaries\" courses (courses 1 and 2 of the Python 3 Programming Specialization). If you are already familiar with Python fundamentals but want practice at retrieving and processing complex nested data from Internet services, you can also benefit from this course without taking the previous two.\n\nThis is the third of five courses in the Python 3 Programming Specialization.","id":"hc1eF91UEeiuIBLeggjX4g","slug":"data-collection-processing-python","instructorIds":["33713149","37849644"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["3"],"name":"Data Collection and Processing with Python"}
