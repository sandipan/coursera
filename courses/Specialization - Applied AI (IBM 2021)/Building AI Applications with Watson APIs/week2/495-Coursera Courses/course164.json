You will continue to build your skill set to use and apply core graphics, touch handling and gestures, animations and transitions, alerts and actions as well as advanced algorithms, threading and more. By the end of this course you will be able to develop a more advanced, fully functioning app.\n\nCurrently this course is taught using Swift 2. The team is aware of the release of Swift 3 and will be making edits to the course in time.
