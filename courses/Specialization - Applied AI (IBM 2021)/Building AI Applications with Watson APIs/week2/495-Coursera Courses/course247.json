With the current surge of veterans reintegrating into civilian society it is critical to improve the training of the next cadre of providers who will provide care for our veterans.  It is widely known that veterans receive care in all aspects of the health system, thus providers in  veteran focused care facilities, military health serves and civilian locals must be aware of the unique needs of veterans.  It is perhaps even more important to educate civilian providers who may be unfamiliar with the unique physical, mental and emotional needs related to military service.\n\nCourse Audience\n - all health professions learners, example:\n - medical students, resident physicians, dental students,\n - nursing students, advanced practice nurses,\n - social work, pharmacy student as graduate level learners\n - as well as any and all health professionals interested in veteran-centered care\n\nWhat You Will Learn:\nThis course will provide learners the opportunity to engage with material to facilitate their understanding of the origins of Academic Medical Centers and Veterans Administration affiliations, recognize and manage the influence of bias, class, and power on the clinical encounter and self-reflect on their biases that particularly affect U.S. military veterans.
