{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"As health informaticists, we need to be very clear in our understanding of the current state (as\n-is), the future state (to-be) and any unintended consequences that can result from our interventions. Prior to introducing large scale change, we need to assess whether a healthcare organization is truly ready for change. This involves taking into account an organization's current culture and values. Successfully leading change through health informatics also requires strategic planning and careful financial considerations. Proper workflow redesign and a clear change management strategy are of utmost importance when introducing new technologies and in ensuring their successful adoption and proper use. \n\nBy the end of this course, students will become familiar with examples of successful and failed attempts at change in health informatics, and the reasons for each. Students will be armed with tools to help optimize their chances for successfully leading change in their respective organizations. ","id":"jePrjEQ1Eeim3goWHozWuA","slug":"leading-change-health-informatics","instructorIds":["37772795"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["8"],"name":"Leading Change in Health Informatics"}
