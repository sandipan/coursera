{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Social media connects us across space and time, allowing us to find like-minded communities and participate creatively in public life as never before.  We may often use social media without thinking much about the possible consequences.   But there is a shadow side associated with social media use, which takes the form of hate speech, increased surveillance, lack of anonymity and questionable use of our data. What do we need to know to use social media spaces effectively, in a way that is safe and productive for all?\n\nThis course will guide you into a deeper exploration of online identity, social media communities and their users.  You will examine the ways that social media is being used by public institutions such as government to build participation and conversation with audiences.  You will encounter the most common ethical debates in social media.  \n\nYou will also have the opportunity to build your practical skills by developing your professional social media profile, defining your audience, building your social media influence and understanding how to interpret data analytics to \"listen\" and communicate well.","id":"5uY2s0U4EeWbNhIvIryYow","slug":"ethical-social-media","instructorIds":["13373862"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["264"],"name":"Ethical Social Media "}
