{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"What happens when creativity and science come together?  The power to design our world is unleashed, providing tools to inform choices about how we live!  Geodesign is the glue—it’s a process that deploys creativity to connect information to people, using collaboration to better inform how we design our world.\n\nThis course includes well-illustrated lectures by the instructor, but also guest lectures each week to ensure you are hearing a variety of viewpoints.  Each week you will also be able to examine what geodesign is through interactive mapping that showcases real-word Case Study examples of geodesign from around the globe.  As you move along in the course, you will discover the interrelationships of both the physical and human aspects that contribute to how geodesign strategies are composed.  The course concludes with you outlining your own Geodesign Challenge, and receiving feedback about that from your peers.","id":"hAyhDM-IEeWWPA4Ee96j6Q","slug":"geodesign","instructorIds":["7223499"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["51"],"name":"Geodesign: Change Your World"}
