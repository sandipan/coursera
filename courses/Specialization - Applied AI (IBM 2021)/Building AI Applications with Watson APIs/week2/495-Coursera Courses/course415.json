{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"How can we live a good life on one planet with over seven billion people? \n\nThis course will explore greening the economy on four levels â€“ individual, business, city, and nation. We will look at the relationships between these levels and give many practical examples of the complexities and solutions across the levels. Scandinavia, a pioneering place advancing sustainability and combating climate change, is a unique starting point for learning about greening the economy. We will learn from many initiatives attempted in Scandinavia since the 1970s, which are all potentially helpful and useful for other countries and contexts.\n\nThe International Institute for Industrial Environmental Economics (IIIEE) at Lund University is an international centre of excellence on strategies for sustainable solutions. The IIIEE is ideally suited to understand and explain the interdisciplinary issues in green economies utilising the diverse disciplinary backgrounds of its international staff. The IIIEE has been researching and teaching on sustainability and greener economies since the 1990s and it has extensive international networks connecting with a variety of organizations.\n\n5-8 hours/week\n5 weeks duration\n40 films\n20 teachers","id":"_j_95QpWEeWoRw4pD4cXmw","slug":"greening-the-economy","instructorIds":["6931825","7951242","7001900","7964300","7955828","5969150","6814134","6925725"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["199"],"name":"Greening the Economy: Lessons from Scandinavia"}
