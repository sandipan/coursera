{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"What is  fluid-solid interactions  ?  It is what happens when the  motions of a fluid and of a solid are somehow coupled. This happens  all the time,  around you when leaves flutter in the wind,  inside you when your heart beats, above you when wings of a plane vibrate, under the sea... The idea behind this MOOC  is to give you the basic tools to  be able to predict and eventually mitigate   things called  flutter, galloping, sloshing, vortex-induced vibrations, added mass,  to cite a few. \n\nWe are going to consider  any  possible domains of applications  such as civil engineering,  aerospace engineering, nuclear engineering , ocean engineering, biomechanics and even food  processing !\n\nThis is why we  called the course “Fundamentals of Fluid Solid Interactions ”. There are so many phenomena and so many models  that  we   need to work together on the basic mechanisms .\n\nIf  you want to see how fluid-solid interactions work,  and be able to use that knowledge, join us !\n\n A first session of the course was run in early 2016, with learners from over 100 countries. It is now  available with subtitles, in English and now in Chinese.\n\nSee the  video  at http://goo.gl/YKSMnD","id":"At1XBOAAEeWoTg63tTECEQ","slug":"fluid-solid-interaction","instructorIds":["10512813","15630275","12595344"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["66"],"name":"Fundamentals of Fluid-Solid Interactions"}
