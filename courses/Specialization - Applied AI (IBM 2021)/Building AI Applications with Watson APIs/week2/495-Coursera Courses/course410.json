{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"This course sets out to provide an understanding of theories of learning and development and how these theories relate to educational technology. It has two components. The first is theoretical, in which we attempt to develop an overall frame of reference, locating approaches to the psychology of learning in terms of large paradigm shifts, from ‘behaviorism’ to ‘brain developmentalism’ to ‘social cognitivism’. The second component is practical, in which we will use these theoretical concepts to ‘parse’ a technology-mediated learning environment for its underlying presuppositions.","id":"HdedLT8sEeeQDg6xSmfOXg","slug":"learning-knowledge-human-development","instructorIds":["3734792","3726726"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["17"],"name":"Learning, Knowledge, and Human Development "}
