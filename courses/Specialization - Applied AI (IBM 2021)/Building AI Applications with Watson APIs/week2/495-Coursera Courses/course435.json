{"courseType":"v2.capstone","description":"This course is open to learners who have completed all eight courses on the Foundations of Teaching for Learning MOOC. It revisits topics covered and focuses on what it really means to be a reflective practitioner. One of the great paradoxes of learning is that the more you know the more you become aware of what you don’t know... and the more you want to know! This course offers an opportunity to further deepen and broaden your professional expertise. It provides an opportunity to participate in practical tasks and assessments that draw on the knowledge and skills gained in the previous courses.  \n\nIf you have completed the eight courses, signed up to the Signature track, met all the assessment requirements of the programme and would like to continue to build on your interest and achievements, this course is for you! There is enough challenge and scope for learners who already have teaching experience, but this course is also suitable for less experienced learners who may not have a great deal of teacher education or may not yet hold a teaching qualification.\n\nAnnouncement for US based teachers:\n\nCoursera and its partners are proud to offer eligible teachers in the US free Course Certificates for this course and other high-quality teacher professional development courses, through the Connected effort announced by President Obama.\n\nTo participate in this opportunity, US district leaders simply need to approve Coursera teacher professional development by completing a brief form at: www.coursera.org/tpd.\n\nUS Teachers interested in this opportunity are also encouraged to follow the link to learn more and www.coursera.org/tpd.\n\nOnce a district’s form has been verified, the district leader will be notified and teachers in the district will receive access to free verified certificates for Coursera professional development.\n\nCoursera and the Commonwealth Education Trust thank educators for the hard work they do every day and hope this opportunity will assist US teachers to continue developing their craft in a meaningful and flexible way.","id":"MexarDV_EeWWBQrVFXqd1w","slug":"teaching-capstone","instructorIds":["3366373","6385631"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["106"],"name":"Foundations of Teaching for Learning Capstone: The Reflective Practitioner"}
