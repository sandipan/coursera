{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Learn how to identify the enablers and barriers to learning transfer. Use your own experience to categorise the processes and activities involved in learning and transferring that learning into practice. There are many criteria against which the success of training and development activities can be judged. One of the most important, however, is learning transfer. Ultimately, the success of any given training and/or development program is reflected in whether or not what is learned is applied on the job. Organisations - and indeed trainees themselves - invest large amounts of time, effort, and resources in work-related training and generally expect to see this manifested in some way back in the work setting (e.g. as observable changes to how work is conducted). However, many organisations and their people view the likelihood of transfer of training more in hope than expectation. This course will show you how to approach the goal of improving learning transfer in your organisation.","id":"qweFXfJJEeaASQ6Jt6TeNg","slug":"intro-learning-transfer","instructorIds":["18095582","1421087"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["30"],"name":"Introduction to Learning Transfer and Life Long Learning (3L)"}
