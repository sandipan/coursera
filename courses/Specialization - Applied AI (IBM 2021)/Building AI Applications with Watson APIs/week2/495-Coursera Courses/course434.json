{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"This course teaches how to design a feedback system to control a switching converter. The equivalent circuit models derived in the previous courses are extended to model small-signal ac variations. These models are then solved, to find the important transfer functions of the converter and its regulator system. Finally, the feedback loop is modeled, analyzed, and designed to meet requirements such as output regulation, bandwidth and transient response, and rejection of disturbances.\n\nUpon completion of this course, you will be able to design and analyze the feedback systems of switching regulators.\n\nThis course assumes prior completion of courses Introduction to Power Electronics and Converter Circuits.","id":"kcW15H3JEeWKYwric11Hpw","slug":"converter-control","instructorIds":["2659612"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["71"],"name":"Converter Control"}
