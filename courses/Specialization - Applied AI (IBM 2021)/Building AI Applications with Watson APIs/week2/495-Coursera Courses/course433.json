{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"This course is an introduction to ecology and ecosystem dynamics using a systems thinking lens. Through a case study on Mozambique's Gorongosa National Park, learners will explore how scientists study ecosystems, and investigate the complex array of factors that inform management efforts. At the end of the course, learners will be able to grapple with real-world conservation questions, such as whether an ecosystem can recover from anthropogenic disruption and what role humans can, and should, play in that recovery.","id":"lnyeIPbxEeeHQRLf02JF5g","slug":"ecology-conservation","instructorIds":["9027900"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["100","497"],"name":"Ecology: Ecosystem Dynamics and Conservation"}
