{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"This course teaches a calculus that enables precise quantitative predictions of large combinatorial structures. In addition, this course covers generating functions and real asymptotics and then introduces the symbolic method in the context of applications in the analysis of algorithms and basic structures such as permutations, trees, strings, words, and mappings.\n\nAll the features of this course are available for free.  It does not offer a certificate upon completion.","id":"jjFwDfBcEeWLaBLI8fdMlw","slug":"analysis-of-algorithms","instructorIds":["250165"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["4"],"name":"Analysis of Algorithms"}
