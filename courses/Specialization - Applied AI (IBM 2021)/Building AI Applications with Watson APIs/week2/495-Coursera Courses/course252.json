{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"The main goal of this course is to get the necessary knowledge on atmospheric and fluid dynamics in order to quantify the wind resource of a local or regional area. \n\nWeâ€™ll learn about basic meteorology, the specific dynamics of turbulent boundary layers and some standard techniques to estimate wind resources regardless of the type of turbine used or the level of efficiency achieved. Then, we will see what are the turbines characteristics to consider in order to estimate the electricity production from an isolated turbine or from a turbine farm. The differences and similarity between wind or marine resource assessment will also be discussed.\n\nFinally, you will have the opportunity to get hands-on experience with real in-situ data sets and apply what you have learned on wind resource assessment.","id":"nOUxQJHMEeWxTA6NLywNHw","slug":"wind-for-renewable-energies","instructorIds":["11918636","25475293","25434469","25545354"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["66"],"name":"Wind resources for renewable energies"}
