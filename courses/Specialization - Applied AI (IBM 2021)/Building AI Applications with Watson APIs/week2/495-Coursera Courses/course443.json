{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"This course provides students with a set of tools and methodologies to plan and initiate a Problem Solving or Quality Improvement project.  The first module presents methods for selecting, scoping and structuring a project before it is even initiated. It also introduces the project classifications of implementation and discovery. The second module describes the A3 problem solving methodology and the tool itself. Further in that same module, the student is shown tools to identify problems in flow, defects, and waste and to discover causes, brainstorm, and prioritize interventions. Module 3 shows a methodology within the implementation class. These methods are designed to overcome emotional and organizational barriers to translating evidence-based interventions into practice.  The fourth and last module looks at one more way to approach improvement projects in the discovery class.  These tools are specifically for new, out-of-the-box design thinking.","id":"Z6YpTXxQEeetPBIrxoVF_A","slug":"patient-safety-project-planning","instructorIds":["26182533"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["8"],"name":"Planning a Patient Safety or Quality Improvement Project (Patient Safety III)"}
