{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"The foundation for this course lies with unique synergies between pioneering research, teaching, and social initiatives through the Subsistence Marketplaces Initiative. Unique to this approach is a bottom-up understanding of the intersection of poverty and the marketplace.\n\nThe goals of this course are to help you develop an understanding of marketplace activity in the radically different context of subsistence where much of humanity resides and survives, and for you to design solutions that can be implemented by individuals, businesses, and social enterprises through economically, ecologically, and socially sustainable products for subsistence marketplaces.","id":"5aTJVUhVEeWJHwqqqPAooQ","slug":"subsistence-marketplaces","instructorIds":["4061619"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["17"],"name":"Subsistence Marketplaces"}
