{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Have you wondered how “Things” talk to each other and the cloud? Do you understand the alternatives for conveying latency-sensitive real time data versus reliable signaling data? Building on the skills from the Sensing and Actuation course, we will explore protocols to exchange information between processors. \n\nIn this course, you will learn how VoIP systems like Skype work and implement your own app for voice calls and text messages.  You will start by using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for session management. Next, you will learn how voice codecs such as Adaptive Multi Rate (AMR) are used in 3G networks and use them for voice traffic in your app. \n\nLearning Goals: After completing this course, you will be able to:\n\n1.\tImplement session initiation, management and termination on your DragonBoard™ 410c using SIP.\n2.\tDiscover other users and exchange device capabilities.\n3.\tCompare and contrast narrowband and wideband codecs and experience the voice quality differences between them.\n4.\tImplement and demonstrate VoIP calls using the DragonBoard 410c.","id":"X4ituSzfEeWl3A7Kuc0JCQ","slug":"internet-of-things-communication","instructorIds":["12279078","12280323"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["53"],"name":"Internet of Things: Communication Technologies"}
