{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"In this course, we deal with the general issues regarding packet switching networks. We discuss packet networks from two perspectives. One perspective involves external view of the network, and is concerned with services that the network provides to the transport layer that operates above it at the end systems. The second perspective is concerned with the internal operation of a network, including approaches directing information across the network, addressing and routing procedures, as well as congestion control inside the network.","id":"4q10vWTrEee1VA7DqjUt-A","slug":"packet-switching-networks-algorithms","instructorIds":["26632591"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["126"],"name":"Packet Switching Networks and Algorithms"}
