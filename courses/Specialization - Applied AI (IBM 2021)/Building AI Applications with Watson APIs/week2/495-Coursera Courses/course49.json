{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Influencer marketing is the practice of engaging internal and industry experts with active networks to help achieve measurable business goals. \n\nThis course is about strategy. Although there is no all-purpose, one-size-fits-all influencer marketing strategy template, you will learn how to tailor one for a wide variety of B2B, B2C, and nonprofit organizations using the two-step flow model of communication.\n \nBut this course is also about tactics. I believe, “Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory. Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat.” So, you will learn both in this 6-week long course.\n\nYour final project for this course is to create a pitch deck for a social media influencer strategy. The purpose of your final project is to give you a concrete artifact that you can use to demonstrate your mastery of new competencies and skills to either the executives in your current organization or to prospective employers.","id":"Axwi2MCtEeedJRJjt8USWA","slug":"influencer-marketing-strategy","instructorIds":["26878288"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["67"],"name":"Influencer Marketing Strategy"}
