{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"This course is an introduction to sequence models and their applications, including an overview of sequence model architectures and how to handle inputs of variable length.\n\n• Predict future values of a time-series\n• Classify free form text\n• Address time-series and text problems with recurrent neural networks\n• Choose between RNNs/LSTMs and simpler models\n• Train and reuse word embeddings in text problems\n\nYou will get hands-on practice building and optimizing your own text classification and sequence models on a variety of public datasets in the labs we’ll work on together.  \n\nPrerequisites: Basic SQL, familiarity with Python and TensorFlow","id":"7sNP37xrEeiL4Q6DgrZ6DA","slug":"sequence-models-tensorflow-gcp","instructorIds":["22997770"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["443"],"name":"Sequence Models for Time Series and Natural Language Processing"}
