{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"The aim of this course is to promote critical thinking with regard to forensic science. Today, in general, most people are dazzled by the technical possibilities offered by forensic science. They somewhat live in the illusion that forensic evidence is fool proof and brings factual findings with 100% certainty. This course – given by specialists in the field – goes beyond the conventional image that is promoted through TV series such as CSI. It alerts (without alarming) the public on the limits of the techniques in order to promote a sound administration of forensic science in the criminal justice system.  It allows participants to understand the importance of probabilistic reasoning in forensic science, because uncertainty is a constitutive part of forensic science. The course is constructed as a series of causes célèbres that could or have led to miscarriages of justice. Some of these cases have been part of case reviews carried out at the School of Criminal Justice of the University of Lausanne.","id":"6Ls0uS4PEei5Xwq_Ud-HLA","slug":"challenging-forensic-science","instructorIds":["8178206","37028863","36997714","19974301"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["159"],"name":"Challenging Forensic Science: How Science Should Speak to Court"}
