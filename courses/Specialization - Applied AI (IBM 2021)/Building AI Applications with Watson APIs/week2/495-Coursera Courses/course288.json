{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Calculus is one of the grandest achievements of human thought, explaining everything from planetary orbits to the optimal size of a city to the periodicity of a heartbeat. This brisk course covers the core ideas of single-variable Calculus with emphases on conceptual understanding and applications. The course is ideal for students beginning in the engineering, physical, and social sciences. Distinguishing features of the course include: 1) the introduction and use of Taylor series and approximations from the beginning; 2) a novel synthesis of discrete and continuous forms of Calculus; 3) an emphasis on the conceptual over the computational; and 4) a clear, dynamic, unified approach.\n\nIn this fourth part--part four of five--we cover computing areas and volumes, other geometric applications, physical applications, and averages and mass.  We also introduce probability.","id":"FXS00V1oEeWK1woL5P9cGQ","slug":"applications-calculus","instructorIds":["227062"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["6"],"name":"Calculus: Single Variable Part 4 - Applications"}
