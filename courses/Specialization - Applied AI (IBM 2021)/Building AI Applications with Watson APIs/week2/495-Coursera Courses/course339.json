{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"In this course, you will learn how to design balancing systems and to compute remaining energy and available power for a battery pack. By the end of the course, you will be able to:\n-\tEvaluate different design choices for cell balancing and articulate their relative merits\n-\tDesign component values for a simple passive balancing circuit\n-\tUse provided Octave/MATLAB simulation tools to evaluate how quickly a battery pack must be balanced\n-\tCompute remaining energy and available power using a simple cell model\n-\tUse provided Octave/MATLAB script to compute available power using a comprehensive equivalent-circuit cell model","id":"uUKe9UGLEeeJdBL3H0RODg","slug":"battery-pack-balancing-power-estimation","instructorIds":["22004840"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["126"],"name":"Battery Pack Balancing and Power Estimation"}
