{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"We introduce low-level TensorFlow and work our way through the necessary concepts and APIs so as to be able to write distributed machine learning models. Given a TensorFlow model, we explain how to scale out the training of that model and offer high-performance predictions using Cloud Machine Learning Engine.\n\nCourse Objectives:\nCreate machine learning models in TensorFlow\nUse the TensorFlow libraries to solve numerical problems\nTroubleshoot and debug common TensorFlow code pitfalls\nUse tf.estimator to create, train, and evaluate an ML model\nTrain, deploy, and productionalize ML models at scale with Cloud ML Engine","id":"-RdrYBzlEeiXawqf8NC2Yg","slug":"intro-tensorflow","instructorIds":["22997770"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["443"],"name":"Intro to TensorFlow"}
