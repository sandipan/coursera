{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Welcome to Integrating Scripts for Scene Interactions, the third course in the Unity Certified 3D Artist Specialization from Unity Technologies.\n\nThe courses in this series will help you prepare for the Unity Certified 3D Artist exam, the professional certification for entry- to mid-level Unity artists. 3D artists are critical to the Unity development pipeline. They are a bridge between the programmers writing the application code and the designers or art directors who define the application’s aesthetics and style. In these courses, you will be challenged to complete realistic art implementation tasks in Unity that are aligned to the topics covered on the exam.\n\nIn this third course, you will complete work on the Kitchen Configurator application - an app that lets users view a realistic rendering of a kitchen and swap out objects and materials to customize the design. Now you’ll work on the allowing users to actually interact with your beautiful design. You’ll implement a User Interface (UI) in Unity and add some pre-written scripts to the project to make it interactive. Finally, you’ll adapt the project to VR with by bringing the UI into world space. By the end of the course, you’ll have a functioning Kitchen Configurator app that would be ready to take to the final stages of production and launch.\n\nThis is an intermediate course, intended for people who are ready for their first paying roles as Unity 3D artists, or enthusiasts who would like to verify their skills against a professional standard. To succeed, you should have at least 1-2 years of experience implementing 3D art in Unity. You should be proficient at importing assets into Unity from Digital Content Creation (DCC) tools, prototyping scenes, working with lighting, and adding particles and effects. You should also have a basic understanding of 2D asset management, animation, and working with scripts. You should have experience in the full product development lifecycle, and understand multi-platform development, including for XR (AR and VR) platforms.","id":"A8fh7cy4Eei0tApsIT9dlg","slug":"integrating-scripts-for-scene-interactions","instructorIds":["33398563","32937405"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["482"],"name":"Integrating Scripts for Scene Interactions"}
