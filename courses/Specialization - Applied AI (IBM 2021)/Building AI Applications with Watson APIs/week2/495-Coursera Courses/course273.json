{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Designing a product is only part of the process. Now, can that product be manufactured? A CNC machinist works with computer numeric controlled (CNC) machines from generating the machine code to machine setup and run. Understanding both CAD and CAM is essential to this portion of a design. Even if you are not the end user who programs a machine, it is invaluable to know how it’s done. This knowledge translates directly to part design by helping make intelligent design decisions with manufacturing in mind. This course introduces you to the integrated CAD/CAM approach behind Fusion 360 CAD/CAM as well as 3D printed design setup and finally assembly and testing. All stages of product design in one place!\n\nAfter completing this course, you will be able to:\n • Explain the Fusion 360 integrated CAD/CAM manufacturing workflow.\n • Summarize the trends that are influencing the future of manufacturing.\n • Demonstrate knowledge and skills in foundational concepts of Fusion 360 CAD/CAM software.\n • Set up a Flight Controller.\n • Assemble a quadcopter.\n • Fly the final design.","id":"FGxleI9gEee2yBIlFMkZng","slug":"manufacturing-process-fusion-360","instructorIds":["29428879"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["470"],"name":"Manufacturing Process with Autodesk Fusion 360"}
