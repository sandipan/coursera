{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Whether students come from a Branding or a Customer Experience background or perspective, this course will explore the synergies between and the intersection of the two sets of activities. While there are different approaches to defining a branding strategy, a branding project’s implementation impacts many departments and their customer-facing activities. In this sense, it’s essential to understand branding efforts in the context of Customer Experience. In this course, we will use a framework - adapted from Customer Journey Mapping - for focusing and organizing students' thinking about the operational implications of their branding projects. Through the framework, we will derive an operational language for aligning activities and measuring impacts across multiple departments and the customer touch points they manage.","id":"jqT6nrHfEeiG4w7I1UJuRA","slug":"branding-and-cx","instructorIds":["36344318"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["61"],"name":"Branding and Customer Experience"}
