{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"What is a musicianâ€™s response to the condition of the world? Do musicians have an obligation and an opportunity to serve the needs of the world with their musicianship?\n \nAt a time of crisis for the classical music profession, with a changing commercial landscape, a shrinking audience base, and a contraction in the number of professional orchestras, how does a young musician construct a career today? Are we looking at a dying art form or a moment of reinvigoration?\n \nIn this course we will develop a response to these questions, and we will explore the notion that the classical musician, the artist, is an important public figure with a critical role to play in society.\n \nThe course will include inquiry into a set of ideas in philosophy of aesthetics; a discussion about freedom, civil society, and ways that art can play a role in readying people for democracy; discussion on philosophy of education as it relates to the question of positive social change; and an exploration of musical and artistic initiatives that have been particularly focused on a positive social impact.\n \nGuiding questions for this course inquiry will include:\n \n      - How can classical music effect social change?\n      - How has music made positive change in communities around the globe?\n      - What can the field of classical music learn from other movements for social change?\n      - How have educators and philosophers thought about the arts and their connection to daily contemporary life?\n \nEach class will explore one critical question through lectures, discussions, interviews, or documentaries.","id":"Kzg9QkDxEeWZtA4u62x6lQ","slug":"music-and-social-action","instructorIds":["14642761"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["109"],"name":"Music and Social Action"}
