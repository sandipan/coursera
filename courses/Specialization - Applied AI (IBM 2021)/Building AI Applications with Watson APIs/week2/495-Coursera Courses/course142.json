{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"If you are a software developer who wants to build scalable AI-powered algorithms, you need to understand how to use the tools to build them. This course is part of the upcoming Machine Learning in Tensorflow Specialization and will teach you best practices for using TensorFlow, a popular open-source framework for machine learning. \n\nThe Machine Learning course and Deep Learning Specialization from Andrew Ng teach the most important and foundational principles of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. This new deeplearning.ai TensorFlow Specialization teaches you how to use TensorFlow to implement those principles so that you can start building and applying scalable models to real-world problems. To develop a deeper understanding of how neural networks work, we recommend that you take the Deep Learning Specialization. \n\nThe full deeplearning.ai TensorFlow Specialization will be available later this year, but you can get started with Course 1, Introduction to Tensorflow for AI, ML and DL, available now on Coursera.","id":"YpwHVDb5EemE7gr4SGSAsA","slug":"introduction-tensorflow","instructorIds":["10261328"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["475"],"name":"Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning"}
