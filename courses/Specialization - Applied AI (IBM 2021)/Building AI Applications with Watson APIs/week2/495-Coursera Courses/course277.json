{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Tired of solving Sudokus by hand? This class teaches you how to solve complex search problems with discrete optimization concepts and algorithms, including constraint programming, local search, and mixed-integer programming.\n\nOptimization technology is ubiquitous in our society. It schedules planes and their crews, coordinates the production of steel, and organizes the transportation of iron ore from the mines to the ports. Optimization clears the day-ahead and real-time markets to deliver electricity to millions of people. It organizes kidney exchanges and cancer treatments and helps scientists understand the fundamental fabric of life, control complex chemical reactions, and design drugs that may benefit billions of individuals.\n\nThis class is an introduction to discrete optimization and exposes students to some of the most fundamental concepts and algorithms in the field. It covers constraint programming, local search, and mixed-integer programming from their foundations to their applications for complex practical problems in areas such as scheduling, vehicleÂ routing, supply-chain optimization, and resource allocation.","id":"THkzKaBPEeWm9xJA1YXcWQ","slug":"discrete-optimization","instructorIds":["1289035","1762431"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["33"],"name":"Discrete Optimization"}
