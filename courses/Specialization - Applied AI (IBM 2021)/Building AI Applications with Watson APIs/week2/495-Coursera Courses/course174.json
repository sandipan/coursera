{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"How can we create nano-structures that are 10,000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair? How can we “see” at the nano-scale?   Through instruction and lab demonstrations, in this course you will obtain a rich understanding of the capabilities of nanotechnology tools, and how to use this equipment for nano-scale fabrication and characterization.  The nanoscale is the next frontier of the Maker culture, where designs become reality.  To become a Nanotechnology Maker pioneer, we will introduce you to the practical knowledge, skills, and tools that can turn your nanotechnology ideas into physical form and that enable you to image objects at the nano-scale. \n\nThis course has been developed by faculty and staff experts in nano-fabrication, electron beam microscopy, and nano-characterization through the Research Triangle Nanotechnology Network (RTNN).  The RTNN offers training and use of the tools demonstrated in this course to schools  and industry through the United States National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure program.  The tools demonstrated in this course are available to the public through the RTNN.","id":"P71s724mEeaWZAqzz79ZVw","slug":"nanotechnology","instructorIds":["1167229","7320131","22530482","21935394"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["7","441","77"],"name":"Nanotechnology: A Maker’s Course"}
