In this course, we will equip you with concepts and tools to build operations in a way that not only supports your competitive strategy, but also allows you to create new opportunities in the market place.\n\nScaling operations: Linking strategy and execution is a five-week course dedicated to making strategic decisions that are grounded in operational reality. Together, we will study how to build and evaluate the “operating system” of the firm to maximize value. This involves tailoring the firm’s operational competencies, assets, and processes to a specific business strategy.\n\nEach week, we’ll explore case studies, engage in discussions and examine realistic data. Thanks to our data-driven approach, you’ll be able to implement your learning directly into practice. At the end of this course, you’ll be ready to build an effective, actionable plan to scale your department or organization.","id":"Cil8XPTgEeSlpiIAC7NwBA","slug":"operations-strategy","instructorIds":["9636752","9635725"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["54"],"name":"Scaling Operations: Linking Strategy and Execution"}
