{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Welcome to Modern Art & Ideas! This course is designed for anyone interested in learning more about modern and contemporary art. Over the next five weeks, you will look at art through a variety of themes: Places & Spaces, Art & Identity, Transforming Everyday Objects, and Art & Society. Each week kicks off with a video that connects works of art from The Museum of Modern Artâ€™s collection to the theme. You will hear audio interviews with artists, designers, and curators and learn more about selected works in the additional readings and resources.\n\nThroughout this course you will discover how artists:\n-- represent place and take inspiration from their environment,\n-- create works of art to express, explore, and question identity,\n-- use everyday objects to challenge assumptions about what constitutes a work of art and how it should be made,\n-- and respond to the social, cultural, and political issues of their time through works of art.\n\nThrough the discussion forum prompts and peer review assignment, you will also have the opportunity to connect with other learners and explore how these themes resonate with your own life and experience.","id":"v9CQdBkhEeWjrA6seF25aw","slug":"modern-art-ideas","instructorIds":["3219339"],"specializations":[],"partnerIds":["107"],"name":"Modern Art & Ideas"}
